# Prompt for 403 Error Page Graphic

## Concept
A professional yet thematic illustration of "closed doors" or a guard dog, matching the "Hau! To nie Twoje podwórko" (Woof! This isn't your backyard) message.

## Visual Style
- **Style**: Minimalist vector illustration, consistent with the 404 graphic.
- **Colors**: Professional, slightly more serious than the 404 page but not aggressive. Uses muted blues and grays.
- **Composition**: Centered, clean, and symbolic.

## Prompt
> A minimalist 2D flat design illustration of a closed, modern wooden garden gate or door with a large, simple padlock on it. A small, polite but firm-looking dog (like a bulldog or a shepherd) is sitting next to the gate, looking forward. Professional vector style, clean lines, monochromatic blue and gray color palette, isolated on a white background. Secure and professional atmosphere.
