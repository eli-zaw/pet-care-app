## 📖 Project Description

**Paw Notes** is a web application designed to solve the common problem of scattered pet care information. Pet owners, especially those with pets requiring regular medical care, medications, and frequent specialist visits, often struggle with:

- **Information fragmentation** - notes stored in different places (phone notes, paper, memory, photos)
- **Lack of accessibility** - difficulty recalling exact dates of vaccinations, medications, or food changes during vet visits
- **Forgotten events** - important health incidents that fade from memory over time
- **Time-consuming systems** - complex management tools that take too long to use

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `22.14.0` (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account (free tier available)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pet-care-app.git
cd pet-care-app
```

2. **Install Node.js version** (using nvm)

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from https://app.supabase.com/ → Your Project → Settings → API
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-public-key
```

**🚨 CRITICAL: For Cloudflare Pages deployment**

The application requires environment variables to be configured in Cloudflare Pages:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select **Workers & Pages**
3. Find your project (`pet-care-app`)
4. Click **Settings** → **Environment variables**
5. Add the following variables for **Production** (and **Preview** if needed):
   - Variable name: `SUPABASE_URL`
     - Value: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - Variable name: `SUPABASE_KEY`
     - Value: Your Supabase anon/public key

6. **Save** and **redeploy** your application

Without these environment variables, the application will fail with: `Error: supabaseUrl is required.`

5. **Start development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit + integration** – `npm run test` initializes the Vitest suite with `jsdom`, shared setup files, and coverage reports. Use `npm run test:watch` during development and `npm run test:unit` when you need an explicit unit-test run that mirrors `npm run test`.
- **End-to-end** – Playwright targets Chromium (Desktop Chrome) only; `npm run test:e2e` launches the server, reuses browser contexts, and records traces/screenshots under `tests/e2e/results`. Use `npm run test:e2e:headed` when you need a visible browser and `npm run test:e2e:codegen` to scaffold new flows.
- **Project structure** – Store reusable selectors and navigation logic in `tests/e2e/pages` (POM), keep screenshots under `tests/e2e/report`, and rely on Playwright hooks for setup/teardown so contexts stay isolated per test.
- **Testing library** – The global setup file (`tests/setup/vitest.setup.ts`) loads `@testing-library/jest-dom`, so component tests can use familiar matchers, while Vitest encourages `expectTypeOf` and `vi` helpers for typed, deterministic assertions.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Before committing
npm run lint        # Check for errors
npm run format      # Format code
npm run test        # Run unit tests

# Testing
npm run test        # Unit and integration tests
npm run test:e2e    # End-to-end tests

# Build for production
npm run build
npm run preview     # Test production build
```
